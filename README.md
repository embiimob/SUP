# Sup!? 
open source experimental decentralized state engine protocol


This Sup!? Object Browser is a READ ONLY demonstration of establishing a decentralized identity and tracking changes with comments on immutable bitcoin objects in a format familiar to NFT enthusiasts. As of Sup?'s first release date all transactions and objects discoverable in this experiment were created by embii using http://apertus.io

### **Installation**

1. Download the Sup.v0.1.0-beta.zip file
2. Create a folder on your **fastest** disk drive with at least **700GB** free (it will be storing the bitcoin prod and testnet blockchains)
3. Unzip all contents into the folder.
4. Create a shortcut to SUP.exe and launch.

**You will need to sync two blockchains to perform you first Sup!? object search**

1. Click the key button
2. Launch a full bitcoin Production node AND a full Bitcoin testnet node using the buttons provided
3. Wait until testnet is fully synched and production has synced passed at least 2014. ( this part could take several hours )
4. Type #flowersofwar in the main search box and hit enter


### **Search Options**

### **#Keywords**
searches up to 20 character keyword shows all object associations
 
### **sup://twitter.com**
searches urn shows currently registered object with URI  ( no urn character limits, redirects are NOT enabled )

### **@UserName**
searches urn shows currently registered profile object associated with @userName


- this experiment uses a v0.13.2 full bitcoin core clone with address index change https://github.com/btcdrak/bitcoin/tree/addrindex-0.14

- this experiment references mazacoin their latest official release has been included in this deployment https://github.com/mazacoin/maza

- see the example transaction JSON files https://github.com/embiimob/Sup/tree/master/P2FK/samples to begin experimenting with the entry and trading of your own Sup!? objects

- Sup!? bitcoin objects can be discovered and browsed without internet access because Sup!? is communicating with a local copy of the blockchain.
